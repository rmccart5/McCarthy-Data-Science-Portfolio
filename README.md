# Welcome to "McCarthy-Data-Science-Portfolio"! ðŸ“ˆ
 + The purpose of this repository is to keep track of all of my projects in the Intro to Data Science course - **all in one place**! ðŸ“‚
 
 + This repository will be **organized using folders** for each assignment and will have **plenty of graphs and visualizations** so anyone who comes across this page can easily understand what I have been working on. ðŸ“Š
