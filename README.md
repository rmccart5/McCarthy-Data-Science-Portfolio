# Welcome to "McCarthy-Data-Science-Portfolio"! 📈
 + The purpose of this repository is to keep track of all of my projects in the Intro to Data Science course - **all in one place**! 📂
 
 + This repository will be **organized using folders** for each assignment and will have **plenty of graphs and visualizations** so anyone who comes across this page can easily understand what I have been working on. 📊

## Basic Streamlit App Project 🐍
**Link to Repository**: https://github.com/rmccart5/McCarthy-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/basic-streamlit-app
### Description 📝
* In this project, we used streamlit to create an app about a dataframe of our choosing
* The dataframe I used consisted of the countries of the world and included a ton of information about each one
* I used functions to create an app that users can use to learn about various countries, filtered by specific characteristics
### Significance ⭐
* This project was a great first project and I learned a lot about how to get more comfortable using datasets and filtering through them
* Additionally, it allowed me to create buttons and build an app that real users can use, which was really rewarding

## Tidy Data Project 🧮
**Link to Repository**: https://github.com/rmccart5/McCarthy-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/730ff9fd8085e990c569ad274ca659e44f9ff5bc/TidyData-Project
### Description 📝
* In this project, we used tidy data principles to organize a messy dataframe
* The dataframe I used consisted of all of the medalists in the 2008 Olympics and which medal they won in each event
* I used functions we discussed in class to make the data into a standard format and then cleaned it up and visualized it
### Significance ⭐
* This project truly builds off of our past work and complements our portfolio very well so far
* While in the basic streamlit app I got familiar with data and limiting it, this project taught me how to manipulate data and clean it up
* In real life, it is rare that you are presented with clean data, so learning how to clean messy data is super important and relevant for my data science career

## Exploring Supervised Machine Learning Streamlit App 🧮
**Link to Repository**: https://github.com/rmccart5/McCarthy-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/MLStreamlitApp

**Link to Public Streamlit App**: https://mccarthy-data-science-portfolio-exploringml.streamlit.app/
### Description 📝
* This app allows users to explore between various datasets and perform multiple machine learning models on the data
* Users can change the models' hyperparameters and learn how these affect the models output and performance
* The app includes various metrics and visuals, making it simple for any user to learn about machine learning
### Significance ⭐
* This project truly took our understanding of data science to the next level
* Creating this app built on my previous understanding of machine learning by allowing me to apply it to real-life data
* Additionally, experimenting with the hyperparameters and looking at their effect on the model performance allowed me to see, behind the scenes, how these complex models work
* This complements my overall portfolio by extending my knowledge from simply analyzing data to know using it to predict outcomes and make decisions, which is crucial in real-world situations
