# Applying Supervised Machine Learning Processes to Various Datasets!üìä
## Project OverviewüëÄ
* The goal of this project is for the user to explore supervised machine learning models and apply them to real life data
* Supervised machine learning is when a model is trained on inputs to predict the outputs of a target variable
* Machine learning models allow us to make predictions, and different metrics and graphs can show us how accurate these predictions are
* In the app, the user can use preset datasets or upload their own dataset and then explore with how different inputs affect the model and its predictions

## Instructionsüß≠
* To run the app, you must first click on the file named "MLStreamlitApp.py" within the "MLStreamlitApp" folder
  - Additionally, you can access the app at the following link: https://mccarthy-data-science-portfolio-exploringml.streamlit.app/
* From there, click the logo labeled "Download raw file" in the top right corner
* When it downloads, click on the file and the code should pop up within Visual Studio Code or Google CoLab
* Make sure to download all of the required libraries and functions, listed below and in the "requirements.txt" channel
  1. graphviz==0.20.1
  2. matplotlib==3.10.1
  3. numpy==2.2.4
  4. pandas==2.2.3
  5. scikit_learn==1.6.1
  6. seaborn==0.13.2
  7. streamlit==1.37.1
* From there, follow the instructions written out in the app, starting with Step 1

## App Featuresüè∑Ô∏è
* The app allows the user some flexibility to explore as they so choose
  - Users can select from 3 provided sample datasets or upload their own CSV file
* Users can choose to either run a linear regression, logistic regression, or decision tree model on the data
  - Linear regression models are used to predict a numeric variable when a roughly linear relationship exists with other variables
  - Logistic regression models are used to predict a binary, categorical variable that's outcome is influenced by multiple features
  - Decision tree models make predictions based on a series of Yes/No questions and mimic human decision-making
* Users can also use sliders to manually change the models hyperparameters, including the target variable, test size, random state, and decision tree max depth
  - Users can explore how each of these affects the model's output
