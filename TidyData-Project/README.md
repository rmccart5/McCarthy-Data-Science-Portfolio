# Tidying the 2008 Olympics Medalists Dataframe!🏅
## Project Overview👀
* The goal of this project was to apply the tidying and visualizing data concepts we learned in class over the past few weeks
* Tidy data principles are concepts that are used to tranform unorganized, messy data into a more structured format. It is a standard way to organize values within a dataset
* Tidying data facilitates analysis and makes it easier to understand
* In tidy data...
  1. Each variable forms a column
  2. Each observation forms a row
  3. Each type of observational unit forms a table

## Instructions🧭
* To run the notebook, you must first click on the file named "TidyData-Project.ipynb" within the "TinyData-Project" folder
* From there, click the logo labeled "Download raw file" in the top right corner
* When it downloads, click on the file and the code should pop up within Visual Studio Code or Google CoLab
* Make sure to import the pandas and matplotlib libraries because the code uses some functions from those packages
* From there, click the play button on the left to run each cell individually or click the run all button at the top to execute everything at once
* After doing all of the above, you have cleaned up the original dataframe and tidied it, while also creating visualizations and aggregations of the data
* Most of all, learn along the way!

## Dataset Description🥇🥈🥉
* The source of the data is TidyData-Project\olympics_08_medalists.csv
* This csv file lists all of the medalists in the 2008 Olympics and the medal they won for each competition
* The author of this dataset is Giorgio Comai (OBCT/CCI) for EDJNet
* The data is initially very untidy so many of the steps taken in my project help tidy it, however all steps are done within the project
