# Tidying the 2008 Olympics Medalists Dataframe!🏅
## Project Overview 👀
* The goal of this project was to apply the tidying and visualizing data concepts we learned in class over the past few weeks.
* Tidy data principles are concepts that are used to tranform unorganized, messy data into a more structured format. It is a standard way to organize values within a dataset.
* Tidying data facilitates analysis and makes it easier to understand.
* In tidy data...
  1. Each variable forms a column
  2. Each observation forms a row
  3. Each type of observational unit forms a table
