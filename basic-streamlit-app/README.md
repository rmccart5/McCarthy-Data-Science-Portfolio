# Welcome to My Basic Streamlit App!🖱️
## Project Overview👀
* The goal of this project is for the user to explore how to work with a large dataset that has information about the countries of the world
* In this project, we used streamlit to create an app about a dataframe of our choosing
* The dataframe I used consisted of the countries of the world and included a ton of information about each one
* The user can use to the app to learn about various countries, filtered by specific characteristics

## Instructions🧭
* To run the app, you must first click on the file named "main.py" within the "basic-streamlit-app" folder
* From there, click the logo labeled "Download raw file" in the top right corner
* When it downloads, click on the file and the code should pop up within Visual Studio Code or Google CoLab
* From there, follow the instructions written out in the app

## App Features🏷️
* The app allows the user some flexibility to explore as they so choose
* Users can select by which variable they want to organize by, turning the large dataset into a much easier to understand subset
* This can be used by anyone hoping to learn about the countries of the world
